Flux Pure Data Sound Engine

This patch is a non-interactive, automated version sound engine of the freely available Flux App for android. Tested with Pd-Vanilla 0.44, Pd-Extended 0.43.3

It incarnates several brilliant useful objects from the RJDJ team, also includes some patch fragments that are freely available on the Pd forums. It would not be possible to build Flux without the Pd community. Some parts might help someone out if working with procedural sound. Share the Source
